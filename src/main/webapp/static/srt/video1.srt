far away....</font>

3
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,735
- Mama.
- We know.

4
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,135
Jyn, gather your things, it's time.

5
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:44,276
Hello.

6
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,386
Saw, it's Lyra.

7
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:47,829
It's happened.

8
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:49,438
He's come for us.

9
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:51,089
You know what to do.

10
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:10,163
Jyn, come here.

11
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:12,901
Remember, whatever I do,

12
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:15,059
I do it to protect you.

13
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:16,918
Say you understand.

14
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:19,174
I understand.

15
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:26,564
- I love you, Stardust.
- I love you too, Papa.

16
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,073
Galen.

17
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,442
Go.

18
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,603
Jyn.

19
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,566
You know where to go, don't you?

20
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,184
Trust the force.

21
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:41,341
You're a hard man to find, Galen.
But farming?

22
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:45,036
Really, a man of your talents?

23
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:47,425
It's a peaceful life.

24
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:50,303
It's lonely, I imagine.

25
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,214
Since Lyra died, yes.

26
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:57,036
Oh.

27
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,163
Oh.

28
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,802
My condolences.

29
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:10,727
Search the house!

30
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,333
Understood.

31
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:21,094
What is it you want?

32
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,543
The work has stalled,
I need you to come back.

33
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:26,447
I won't do it, Krennic.

34
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:30,062
We're on the verge of greatness.
We were this close

35
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:33,661
to providing peace,
security for the galaxy.

36
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,840
You're confusing peace with terror.

37
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:37,236
Do I, huh?

38
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,384
You have to start somewhere.

39
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,702
I'll be of no help, Krennic.

40
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,531
My mind just isn't
what it was.

41
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,798
I have trouble remembering,

42
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,449
even simple things.

43
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,429
Galen,

44
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,484
you're an inspired scientist
but you're a terrible liar.

45
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:04,454
Now I admire the effort,
I really do.

46
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:09,890
Oh look, here's Lyra back from the dead.
It's a miracle.

47
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,243
Stop!

48
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:20,785
Oh, Lyra.
Troublesome as ever.

49
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,990
You're not taking him.

50
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:25,173
No, of course I'm not.
I'm taking you all.

51
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,062
You'll all come.
You, your child,

52
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:29,888
- You'll all live in comfort.
- As hostages.

53
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,382
As 'heroes of the Empire.'

54
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:35,160
Lyra.

55
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,091
Put it down.

56
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:40,232
Think very carefully.

57
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,014
- You will never win.
- Do it.

58
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,277
Lyra!

59
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:55,398
No!

60
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,816
They have a child.

61
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:01,788
Find it!

62
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,034
My child.

63
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,567
Come.

64
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:38,363
Come.

65
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:42,359
We have a long ride
ahead of us.

66
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:53,451
<font color="#ffff80">ROGUE ONE</font>

67
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,219
Check in, security.
Cell block 4227

68
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:27,360
4227

69
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:31,173
- I was about to leave.
- I came as fast as I could.

70
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:32,501
I have to get back on board.

71
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,244
- Walk with me.
- Back to Jedha?

72
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,657
They'll leave without me!

73
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:38,858
Easy. You have news from Jedha?
Come on.

74
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:45,379
An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers.
He defected yesterday.

75
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:47,562
He's telling people
they're making a weapon.

76
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,585
The kyber crystals,
that's what they're for.

77
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,628
What kind of weapon?

78
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:53,118
- Look, I have to go.
- What kind of weapon?

79
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:56,167
A planet killer.
That's what he called it.

80
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,903
A planet killer?

81
00:09:57,928 --> 00:09:59,845
Someone named Erso sent him.

82
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,616
- Some old friend of Saw's.
- Galen Erso?

83
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:05,584
- Was it?
- I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left.

84
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:08,518
- Who else knows this?
- I have no idea!

85
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:10,510
It's all falling apart.

86
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,448
Saw's right, there're spies everywhere

87
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,017
What's all this?

88
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:19,067
Come on, let's see some scandocs.

89
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,875
Yeah, of course.
My gloves?

90
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,191
No…

91
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,882
What've you done?

92
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,981
Troopers down, section 9.

93
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:33,817
Are you crazy?

94
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,337
I'll never climb out of here.
My arm...

95
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,806
Get out of the way.
Move! Move!

96
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,810
Calm down.
Calm down.

97
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,051
We'll be all right.

98
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,797
Is that him?

99
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:35,423
He looks kind of different

100
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,349
than I imagined.

101
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,816
Okay,
so you're-you're Saw Gerrera?

102
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,773
Saw Gerrera.
No?

103
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,236
Okay, we're just wasting
time that we don't have.

104
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:54,065
I need to speak to Saw Gerrera!
I keep telling them before, before it's too late.

105
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,574
We're out here in the middle of nowhere.
We need to get to Jedha City.

106
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:04,036
What part of urgent message
do you guys not understand?

107
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,701
Hey!

108
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:09,075
we're all on the same side, if you just
see past the uniform for a minute…

109
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,190
I've got to speak to ah...
I've got to speak to Saw Gerrera.

110
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,451
What now?

111
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:56,568
I don't know.
Must be another pick up.

112
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:59,444
I thought we had everybody.

113
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,322
-All clear, sir.
- Hallik!

114
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,824
- Liana Hallik!
- Her.

115
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,243
You want to get out of here?

116
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,252
Hey!
What about me?

117
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:33,323
Congratulations.
You are being rescued

118
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:35,918
Please do not resist.

119
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:57,694
LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.

120
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:15,039
You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik.
Is that correct?

121
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:19,461
Possession of unsanctioned weapons,
forgery of Imperial documents,

122
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:24,188
aggravated assault,
escape from custody, resisting arrest…

123
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:30,146
Imagine if the Imperial authorities had
found out who you really were. Jyn Erso?

124
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:33,328
That's your given name, is it not?

125
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:37,471
Jyn Erso?
Daughter of Galen Erso.

126
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:40,961
A known Imperial collaborator
in weapons development.

127
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,138
What is this?

128
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,583
It's a chance for you
to make a fresh start.

129
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:51,012
We think you might be
able to help us.

130
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,411
This is Captain Cassian Andor,
Rebel Intelligence.

131
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:59,474
When was the last time you were
in contact with your father?

132
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,565
15 years ago.

133
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,557
Any idea where he's been
all that time?

134
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:10,936
I like to think he's dead,
makes things easier.

135
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:14,620
Easier than what? That he's being a tool
of the Imperial war machine?

136
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:18,609
- I've never had the luxury of political opinions.
- Really?

137
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,614
When was your last contact
with Saw Gerrera?

138
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,330
It's been a long time.

139
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:33,574
He'd remember you, though,
wouldn't he?

140
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,969
He might agree to meet you,
if you came as a friend.

141
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:39,933
We're up against the clock here, girl,
So if there's nothing to talk about,

142
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,588
we'll just put you back
where we found you.

143
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:44,485
I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life.

144
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,361
He raised me. But I've no idea where he is.
 I haven't seen him in years.

145
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:50,222
We know how to find him,
that's not our problem.

146
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:54,299
What we need is someone who gets us
through the door without being killed.

147
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,058
You're all rebels, aren't you?

148
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,152
Yes, but Saw Gerrera's an extremist.

149
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:03,274
He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.

150
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,899
His militancy has caused the Alliance
a great many problems.

151
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:13,164
We have no choice now but to try
to mend that broken trust.

152
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,638
What does this have
to do with my father?

153
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,583
There's an Imperial defector in Jedha.
A pilot.

154
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,490
He's being held by Saw Gerrera.

155
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:32,670
He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon
with the power to destroy entire planets.

156
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:38,783
The pilot says he was
sent by your father.

157
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:42,840
We need to stop this
weapon before it is finished.

158
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:47,181
Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate
the pilot's story and then, if possible, find your father.

159
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,881
It appears he is critical to the
development of this superweapon.

160
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:54,619
Given the gravity of the situation
and your history with Saw,

161
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:59,512
we're hoping that he will help us locate your father
and return him to the Senate for testimony.

162
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,478
And if I do it?

163
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,849
We'll make sure you go free.

164
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:34,473
Captain Andor!

165
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,682
I'm Kay-Tuesso (K-2SO)

166
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:52,430
I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.

167
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:53,919
I remember you.

168
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:57,695
I see the Council is sending you
with us to Jedha.

169
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,126
Apparently so.

170
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:03,104
That is a bad idea.

171
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:06,185
I think so, and so does Cassian.

172
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:14,084
What do I know?
My specialty is just strategic analysis.

173
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:17,082
Galen Erso is vital to the
Empire's weapon program.

174
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:20,042
Forget what you heard in there,
there will be no extraction.

175
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:23,492
You find him,
you kill him.

176
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,184
Then and there.

177
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,307
You met Kay-Tu?

178
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:38,786
Charming.

179
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:41,991
He tends to say whatever
comes into his circuits.

180
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,896
 It's a by-product of the reprogram.

181
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:47,600
Why does she get a blaster,
and I don't?

182
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,898
- What.
- I know how to use it.

183
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,808
That's what I'm afraid of.
Give it to me.

184
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,195
We're going to Jedha.
That's a war zone.

185
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:01,860
That's not the point.

186
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:04,207
- Where did you get it?
- I found it.

187
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:07,274
I find that answer
vague and unconvincing.

188
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,511
Trust goes both ways.

189
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,185
You're letting her keep it?

190
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:25,711
Would you like to know the probability
of her using it against you?

191
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:31,172
- It's high.
- Let's get going.

192
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:33,087
It's very high.

193
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:14,461
Lies!

194
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,642
Deceptions!

195
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,217
Let's see it.

196
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,876
Bodhi Rook.
Cargo pilot.

197
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,530
- Local boy, huh?
- Uh-huh.

198
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,199
Okay, I can hear you.

199
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:39,656
He didn't capture me,
I came here myself.

200
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:41,295
I defected, I defected.

201
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,995
Every day, more lies.

202
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:46,434
Lies?

203
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:48,988
Would I risk everything for a lie?
No, we don't have time for this!

204
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,612
I have to speak to Saw Gerrera
before it's too late.

205
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,389
Okay...

206
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,554
So, you...

207
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,462
Um.

208
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,368
Uh.
That's-That's for you.

209
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:11,101
And I gave it to them,
they did not find it!

210
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,657
I gave it to them.

211
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,413
Galen Erso.

212
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:20,137
He told me to find you.

213
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,140
Bor Gullet.

214
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,111
Bor Gullet?

215
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,251
Galen Erso sent me!

216
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,408
He told me to find you!

217
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:26,289
Most unfortunate about the security breach
on Jedha, Director Krennic.

218
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:30,427
After so many setbacks and delays,
and now this.

219
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:38,952
We've heard word of rumors
circulating through the city.

220
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:43,110
Apparently you've lost
a rather talkative cargo pilot.

221
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:47,141
If the Senate gets wind of our project,
countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.

222
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:53,069
When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin,
the Senate will be of little concern.

223
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:58,581
When has become now, Director Krennic.
The Emperor will tolerate no further delay,

224
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:02,556
you have made time
an ally of the Rebellion.

225
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:09,583
I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously
with an immediate test of the weapon.

226
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:17,599
Failure will find you explaining why
to a far less patient audience.

227
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,472
I will not fail.

228
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:01,648
What's the matter, Jyn?
You looked frightened.

229
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:06,414
I'll always protect you.

230
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,692
Stardust.

231
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:15,730
Don't ever change.

232
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,308
Trust...

233
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,319
Galen.

234
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:39,460
We're coming into orbit.
You have controls.

235
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:53,136
That's Jedha.

236
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,506
Or what's left of it.

237
00:24:58,021 --> 00:25:01,174
We find Saw,
we find your father.

238
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,212
What's with the Destroyer?

239
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:50,523
It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera.

240
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,294
He's been attacking the cargo shipments.

241
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:55,826
What are they bringing in?

242
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,289
It's 'what are they taking out?'

243
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:03,730
Kyber crystal.
All they can get.

244
00:26:03,755 --> 00:26:07,144
We wondered why they were
stripping the temple, now we know.

245
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:09,509
It's the fuel for the weapon.

246
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,840
The weapon your father's building.

247
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,327
Maybe we should leave
target practice behind.

248
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:17,577
Are you talking about me?

249
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:19,411
She's right.

250
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:21,685
We need to blend in.
Stay with the ship.

251
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,314
I can blend in.
I'm an Imperial droid.

252
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:27,095
This city is under Imperial occupation

253
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,371
Half the people here want to reprogram you.
The other half want to put a hole in your head.

254
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:34,325
I'm surprised you're so concerned
with my safety.

255
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,669
I'm not. I'm just worried
they might miss you and hit me.

256
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,764
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

257
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:11,226
Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts,

258
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:17,853
No lie is safe.

259
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:27,185
What have you really
brought me, cargo pilot?

260
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,596
Bor Gullet will know the truth.

261
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:36,961
The unfortunate side effect,

262
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:42,213
- is that one tends to lose one's mind.
- No.

263
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:14,803
Hey, you just watch yourself.

264
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:18,702
No, no.
Tourist, we don't want any trouble, sorry.

265
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,717
Come on.
Come on.

266
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,756
Citizens of Jedha,

267
00:28:22,796 --> 00:28:27,761
you must come forward with information
of the location of this missing cargo pilot.

268
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:32,055
A reward of 600 credits for the
information shall be awarded.

269
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,129
I had a contact,
one of Saw's rebels,

270
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:39,819
but he's just gone missing.
His sister will be looking for him.

271
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:43,510
The temple's been destroyed
but she'll be there waiting.

272
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:47,050
We'll give her your name and hope
that gets us a meeting with Saw.

273
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:48,561
Hope?

274
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,419
Yeah.
Rebellions are built on hope.

275
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:55,079
Hands where I can see them.
Get over there.

276
00:28:55,104 --> 00:28:58,007
Show me some identification.
Check inside.

277
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:01,581
Is this all because of your pilot?

278
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,441
May the Force of others be with you.

279
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,376
- May the Force of others be with you.
- Wait for me.

280
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:14,454
May the Force of others be with you.

281
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,696
May the Force of others be with you.

282
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:21,281
Would you trade that necklace
for a glimpse into your future?

283
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,384
Yes, I'm speaking to you.

284
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:35,682
I am Chirrut Îmwe.

285
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,348
How did you know
I was wearing a necklace?

286
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,571
For that answer you must pay.

287
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:47,674
What do you know of kyber crystals?

288
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:52,549
My father, he said they powered
the Jedi lightsabers.

289
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:56,963
Jyn.
Come on, let's go.

290
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:03,377
The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.

291
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,110
Let's go.

292
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,851
We're not here to make friends.

293
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,739
Who are they?

294
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,492
The Guardians of the Whills.

295
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:19,970
Protectors of the Kyber Temple.

296
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:25,077
But there's nothing left to protect, so
now they're just causing trouble for everybody.

297
00:30:26,683 --> 00:30:28,683
You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.

298
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:33,213
We have to hurry.
This town—it's ready to blow.

299
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:36,405
Citizens of the Empire,

300
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,724
Imperial forces...

301
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:06,684
Tell me you have a backup plan.

302
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:13,482
Incoming.

303
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,058
Put your guns down.

304
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:17,750
Behind us.

305
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,651
Looks like we found Saw's rebels.

306
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,153
Jyn, no!

307
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,384
Thank you.

308
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:56,228
Hit the tower.

309
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,946
Get out of there!

310
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:31,202
Quickly, the kyber, get it.

311
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,067
Here, take the kyber.

312
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:36,782
Take the kyber.

313
00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:40,315
Come on!

314
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:01,433
This way!

315
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,316
Did you know that wasn't me?

316
00:33:30,402 --> 00:33:31,334
Of course!

317
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,632
I thought I told
you to stay on the ship

318
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:38,187
You did, but I thought it was boring,
and you were in trouble.

319
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:42,734
There are a lot of explosions
for two people blending in.

320
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,174
Freeze right there...

321
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:49,437
You're right,
I should just wait on the ship.

322
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:03,405
Halt!
Stop right there!

323
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,550
Where are you taking these prisoners?

324
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:11,671
- These are prisoners.
- Yes. Where are you taking them?

325
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:16,433
I am taking them... to imprison them.
In prison.

326
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,819
- He's taking us to...
- Quiet!

327
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:21,284
And there's a fresh one
if you mouth off again!

328
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,490
- We'll take them from here.
- That's okay.

329
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:25,514
If you could just point me in the right direction,
I can take them, I'm sure.

330
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,179
- I've taken them this far—
- Hey, wait a second.

331
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:28,359
- Take them away.
- Wait!
- Hey, droid.

332
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:29,933
You can't take them away!

333
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:33,189
You stay here.
We need to check your diagnostics.

334
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:34,590
Diagnostics?

335
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,710
I'm capable of running my own diagnostics,
thank you very much.

336
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:39,939
Let them pass in peace!

337
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:47,441
Let them pass in peace.

338
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:52,665
The Force is with me,
and I am with the Force.

339
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:57,131
And I fear nothing,
for all is as the Force wills it.

340
00:34:57,156 --> 00:34:59,193
Hey!
Stop right there!

341
00:34:59,218 --> 00:35:00,358
He's blind.

342
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:03,948
Is he deaf?
I said: Stop right there!

343
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:19,382
Is your foot all right?

344
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:54,512
You almost shot me.

345
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,344
You're welcome.

346
00:36:00,414 --> 00:36:02,276
Clear of hostiles!

347
00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:04,610
- One hostile!
- He's with us!

348
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:06,434
They're all right.

349
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,267
Thanks.

350
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,647
Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.

351
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:21,990
Go back to the ship.
Wait for my call.

352
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,193
Is he a Jedi?

353
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,996
There are no Jedi here anymore.

354
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,713
Only dreamers like this fool.

355
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:32,338
The Force did protect me.

356
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:33,746
I protected you.

357
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:35,958
Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?

358
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:46,937
Can't you see
we are no friends of the Empire?

359
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:54,057
Anyone who kills me or my friends
will answer to Saw Gerrera,

360
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:59,404
Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso.

361
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:07,350
Are you kidding me?
I'm blind!

362
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:47,343
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

363
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,978
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

364
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,049
You pray?

365
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:53,401
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

366
00:38:53,426 --> 00:38:54,501
Really?

367
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:56,754
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

368
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,112
He's praying for the door to open.

369
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:02,259
It bothers him,
because he knows it is possible.

370
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:08,298
Baze Malbus was once
the most devoted Guardian of us all.

371
00:39:08,907 --> 00:39:12,355
I'm beginning to think the Force
and I have different priorities.

372
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:15,845
Relax, Captain.
We've been in worse cages than this one.

373
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,204
This is a first for me.

374
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:22,455
There is more than
one sort of prison, Captain,

375
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,421
I sense that you carry yours
wherever you go.

376
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,200
Jyn.

377
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,842
Is it really you?

378
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,533
I can't believe it.

379
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,282
Must be quite a surprise.

380
00:39:56,307 --> 00:40:00,643
Are we not still friends?

381
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:03,148
The last time I saw you, you gave me
a knife and loaded blaster

382
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:05,698
and told me to wait
in a bunker until daylight.

383
00:40:05,723 --> 00:40:07,782
I knew you were safe.

384
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:09,926
You left me behind.

385
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,112
You were already
the best soldier in my cadre.

386
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:14,181
- I was sixteen.
- I was protecting you!

387
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,369
You dumped me!

388
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:19,160
You were the daughter
of an Imperial science officer!

389
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,778
People were starting to figure that out.

390
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:26,296
People who wanted to-
to use you as a hostage.

391
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:33,659
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of you…

392
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:42,513
But today, of all days?

393
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:50,572
It's a trap, isn't it?

394
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:52,381
What?

395
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:53,966
The pilot!

396
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:57,258
The message.
All of it.

397
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,567
Did they...

398
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:13,842
send you?

399
00:41:16,164 --> 00:41:21,274
Did you come here to kill me?

400
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,703
There's not much of me left.

401
00:41:24,728 --> 00:41:27,009
The Alliance wants my father.

402
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,926
They think he's sent you
a message about a weapon.

403
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:33,685
I guess they think by sending me
you might actually help them out.

404
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:40,185
So what is it that you want, Jyn?

405
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:44,681
They wanted an introduction,
they've got it.

406
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:48,271
I'm out now.
The rest of you can do what you want.

407
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:51,769
You care not about the cause?

408
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:53,737
The cause?

409
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:55,315
Seriously?

410
00:41:56,254 --> 00:41:58,244
The Alliance?
The...

411
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:01,043
The rebels? Whatever it is
you're calling yourself these days?

412
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:03,420
All it's ever brought me is pain.

413
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:10,697
You can stand to see the Imperial flag
reign across the galaxy?

414
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:13,282
It's not a problem
if you don't look up.

415
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,772
I have something to show you,

416
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:21,181
come.

417
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,071
The Emperor is awaiting my report.

418
00:42:40,096 --> 00:42:43,225
One had hoped that he and Lord Vader
might have been here for such an occasion.

419
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,916
And I thought it prudent to save
you from any potential embarrassment.

420
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:48,339
Your concern is hardly warranted.

421
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:51,349
If saying it would only make it so.

422
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:59,133
All Imperial forces, have been evacuated,
and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.

423
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:02,494
That won't be necessary.
We need a statement, not a manifesto.

424
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:05,284
The Holy City will be
enough for the day.

425
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:09,796
Target Jedha City,
prepare single reactor ignition.

426
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:16,956
- Sir, we're in position, ready to...
- Fire!

427
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,700
Commence primary ignition.

428
00:43:23,022 --> 00:43:25,087
Who's the one in the next cell?

429
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:26,536
What?

430
00:43:26,848 --> 00:43:28,188
Where?

431
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:35,011
An Imperial pilot.

432
00:43:35,131 --> 00:43:36,288
- Pilot?
- I'm going to kill Kim!

433
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,673
- No, no, No, wait!
- Come here!

434
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,039
NO!

435
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:41,301
Back off.
Back off.

436
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,690
Okay.

437
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,743
Are you the pilot?

438
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:54,328
Hey, hey—are you the pilot?
The shuttle pilot?

439
00:43:54,353 --> 00:43:55,677
Pilot?

440
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:57,669
What's wrong with him?

441
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,020
Galen Erso.

442
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,406
You know that name?

443
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:09,401
I brought the message, I'm the pilot.

444
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:16,360
I'm the pilot.

445
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,817
I'm the pilot.

446
00:44:18,842 --> 00:44:20,558
Okay, good.

447
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,007
Now where is Galen Erso?

448
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:28,197
Standby.

449
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:36,325
This is the message I was sent.

450
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:42,529
Saw, if you're watching this,

451
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,453
then perhaps there is a chance
to save the Alliance.

452
00:44:45,478 --> 00:44:50,385
Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and,
though I don't dare hope for too much,

453
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,900
a chance for Jyn,
if she's alive,

454
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:55,051
if you can possibly find her…

455
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:57,332
to let her know that

456
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:02,917
my love for her has never faded
and how desperately I've missed her.

457
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:09,067
Jyn, my Stardust,

458
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:12,577
I can't imagine
what you think of me.

459
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:16,475
When I was taken,
I faced some bitter truths.

460
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:20,275
I was told that, soon enough,
Krennic would have you as well.

461
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,625
As time went by,
I knew that you were either dead

462
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,883
or so well hidden that
he would never find you.

463
00:45:25,908 --> 00:45:28,294
I knew if I refused to work,

464
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,508
if I took my own life,
it would only be a matter of time

465
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:34,430
before Krennic realized he no longer
needed me to complete the project.

466
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:38,685
So I did the one thing
that nobody expected: I lied.

467
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,592
I learned to lie.

468
00:45:40,617 --> 00:45:44,835
 I played the part of a beaten man
resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

469
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,791
 I made myself indispensable,

470
00:45:46,816 --> 00:45:51,084
and all the while
I laid the groundwork of my revenge.

471
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:53,617
We call it the Death Star.

472
00:45:53,642 --> 00:45:55,063
There is no better name.

473
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:58,885
And the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.

474
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,753
I've placed a weakness deep within the system.

475
00:46:01,778 --> 00:46:04,697
A flaw so small and powerful,
they'll never find it.

476
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,440
But, Jyn.
Jyn, if you're listening…

477
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:12,433
My beloved, so much of my life
has been wasted.

478
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:16,459
I try to think of you
only in the moments when I'm strong,

479
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,224
because the pain of not
having you with me…

480
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:20,697
Your mother.

481
00:46:21,152 --> 00:46:22,515
Our family.

482
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,913
The pain of that loss is so overwhelming
I risk failing even now.

483
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:29,467
It's just so hard
not to think of you.

484
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,369
Think of where you are.

485
00:46:34,552 --> 00:46:36,285
My Stardust.

486
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,840
Saw, the reactor module,
that's the key.

487
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,041
That's the place I've laid my trap.

488
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,541
It's well hidden and unstable,

489
00:46:45,566 --> 00:46:49,314
one blast to any part of it
will destroy the entire station.

490
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:51,273
You'll need the plans,

491
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:54,429
the structural plans for the Death Star
to find the reactor.

492
00:46:54,454 --> 00:46:57,965
I know there's a complete
engineering archive in the data vault

493
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,312
at the Citadel Tower on Scarif.

494
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:03,499
Any pressurized explosion
to the reactor module will set off

495
00:47:03,524 --> 00:47:06,753
a chain reaction that will
destroy the entire station...

496
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:35,001
Go.
Go.

497
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:40,421
K-2?
K-2, where are you?

498
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:41,651
There you are.

499
00:47:41,676 --> 00:47:46,503
I'm standing by as you requested.
Although there's a problem on the horizon.

500
00:47:46,645 --> 00:47:49,049
There is no horizon.

501
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:52,101
Locate our position.
Bring that ship in here now!

502
00:47:52,126 --> 00:47:53,503
Where are you going?

503
00:47:53,528 --> 00:47:55,431
I've got to find Jyn.

504
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,361
- Get the pilot. We need him.
- All right.

505
00:47:58,386 --> 00:48:00,433
I'll get the pilot.

506
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:09,576
Pilot.

507
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:11,996
No, no, no.

508
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,124
Let's go.

509
00:48:15,149 --> 00:48:16,594
Jyn!

510
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,335
We've got to go.

511
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:28,744
I know where your father is.

512
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,125
Go with him, Jyn.

513
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:33,092
You must go.

514
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,644
- Come with us.
- I will run no longer.

515
00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:39,217
- Come on.
- But you must save yourself.

516
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:40,405
- Come on.
- Go!

517
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,001
There's no time!

518
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,435
Save the Rebellion!

519
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,545
Save the dream!

520
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:09,875
Oh.
It's beautiful.

521
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:21,207
Chirrut, let's go!

522
00:49:22,194 --> 00:49:25,333
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

523
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,467
Get us out of here!
Punch it!

524
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,467
- I'm not very optimistic about our role.
- Let's not, K

525
00:50:35,308 --> 00:50:36,941
Come on!

526
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:43,212
- Punch it.
- I haven't completed my calculation.

527
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:45,304
I'll make them for you.

528
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:16,822
I believe I owe you
an apology, Director Krennic.

529
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:20,657
Your work exceeds all expectations.

530
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,864
And you'll tell the Emperor as much?

531
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:27,872
I will tell him his patience with your
misadventures has been rewarded

532
00:51:27,897 --> 00:51:31,243
with a weapon that will bring
a swift end to the Rebellion.

533
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:35,240
That was only an inkling
of it's destructive potential—

534
00:51:35,265 --> 00:51:37,922
I will tell him, that I will be
taking control over the weapon

535
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:41,840
I first spoke of years ago…
effective immediately.

536
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:50,424
We stand here amid
my achievement—not yours!

537
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:55,839
I'm afraid these recent security breaches have
laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.

538
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:58,333
The breaches have been filled,

539
00:51:58,358 --> 00:52:00,565
Jedha has been silenced.

540
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,753
You think this pilot acted alone?

541
00:52:02,778 --> 00:52:06,606
He was dispatched from
the installation on Eadu.

542
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:10,083
Galen Erso's facility.

543
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:15,284
We'll see about this.

544
00:52:19,644 --> 00:52:22,302
A coded message from Captain Andor, sir.

545
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:25,690
Weapon confirmed.
Jedha destroyed.

546
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:29,436
Mission target located on Eadu.
Please advise.

547
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:31,085
Destroyed?

548
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:37,413
Proceed.

549
00:52:38,298 --> 00:52:41,030
Tell him my orders still stand.

550
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:44,877
Tell him to proceed with haste
and keep to the plan.

551
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:47,489
We have no idea what he is
building for the Empire.

552
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:50,626
We have to kill Galen Erso
while we have the chance.

553
00:53:00,735 --> 00:53:03,701
Baze, tell me.

554
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,531
All of it?

555
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,313
The whole city?

556
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:14,268
- Tell me.
- All of it.

557
00:53:21,794 --> 00:53:23,247
Understood.

558
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:32,774
Set a course for Eadu.

559
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,304
Setting course for Eadu.

560
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:36,328
Is that where my father is?

561
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,654
I think so.

562
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:40,691
So you're Galen's daughter.

563
00:53:40,897 --> 00:53:41,998
You know him?

564
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:44,804
I'm Bodhi, the pilot.

565
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:46,268
You brought the message.

566
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,761
Yes, your father...

567
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,500
He said I could get right by myself.

568
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:55,626
He said I could make it right,
if I was brave enough

569
00:53:56,622 --> 00:53:58,810
and listened to what
was in my heart.

570
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:01,224
Do something about it.

571
00:54:04,038 --> 00:54:05,907
Guess it was too late.

572
00:54:06,815 --> 00:54:08,150
It wasn't too late.

573
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,718
Seems pretty late to me.

574
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:12,124
No.

575
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,905
We can beat the people
who did this.

576
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:18,645
My father's message, I've seen it.

577
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,358
They call it the Death Star.

578
00:54:21,861 --> 00:54:25,011
But they have no idea
there's a way to defeat it.

579
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:27,186
You're wrong about my father.

580
00:54:27,526 --> 00:54:30,957
- He did build it.
- Because he knew they'd do it without him.

581
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:32,491
My father made a choice.

582
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:35,089
He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.

583
00:54:35,114 --> 00:54:36,734
He's rigged a trap inside it

584
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:39,328
That's why he sent you.
To bring that message.

585
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:40,871
Where is it?

586
00:54:40,896 --> 00:54:42,565
Where's the message?

587
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,667
It was a hologram.

588
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:50,584
You have that message, right?

589
00:54:56,235 --> 00:54:58,469
Everything happened so fast.

590
00:54:59,555 --> 00:55:01,143
Did you see it?

591
00:55:03,521 --> 00:55:05,399
You don't believe me.

592
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:08,529
I'm not the one
you've got to convince.

593
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:10,397
I believe her.

594
00:55:11,936 --> 00:55:13,335
That's good to know.

595
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,274
What kind of trap?

596
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,542
You said your father made a trap.

597
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:18,561
The reactor

598
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:20,630
He's placed a weakness there.
He's been hiding it for years.

599
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:25,009
He said if you can blow the reactor-
the module- the whole system goes down.

600
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:27,489
You need to send word
to the Alliance.

601
00:55:27,514 --> 00:55:28,546
I've done that.

602
00:55:28,571 --> 00:55:30,820
They have to know
there's a way to destroy this thing.

603
00:55:30,846 --> 00:55:34,366
- They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.
- I can't risk sending that.

604
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:36,952
We're in the heart of Imperial territory.

605
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:39,985
Then we'll find him.
And bring him back,

606
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:43,248
and he can tell them himself.

607
00:56:00,628 --> 00:56:02,999
Course set for Eadu, sir.

608
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,764
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

609
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:25,756
20 egress to the right.

610
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:27,969
10 degrees up.

611
00:56:27,994 --> 00:56:30,036
No, no, no, lower.
Lower!

612
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:31,548
Are you sure this is the way?

613
00:56:31,573 --> 00:56:33,691
They have landing trackers.
They have patrol squadrons.

614
00:56:33,716 --> 00:56:35,876
You've got to stay in the canyon,
keep it low.

615
00:56:40,145 --> 00:56:41,769
Watch your right!

616
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,600
There's a 26% chance of failure.

617
00:56:47,624 --> 00:56:48,730
How much farther?

618
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:50,537
I don't know.
I'm not sure, I never really come this way,

619
00:56:50,562 --> 00:56:52,258
but we're close, we're close.
I know that.

620
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:55,570
- Well, now there's a 35% chance of failure.
- I don't want to know, thank you.

621
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:57,143
I understand.

622
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,296
- Now! Put it down now!
- The wind...

623
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:03,231
If you keep going, you'll be
right over the shuttle depot.

624
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:04,826
- Watch out!
- Hey!

625
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,113
Hold on tight!
We're coming down hard!

626
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:25,712
- Try them again.
- I am, sir. We...

627
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:28,501
The signal's gone dead.

628
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:33,833
Squadron up, target Eadu.

629
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,373
How about now, check stabilizers?

630
00:57:49,104 --> 00:57:51,788
- Bodhi, where's the lab?
- The research facility?

631
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:52,988
Yeah.
Where is it?

632
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:54,797
It's just over the ridge.

633
00:57:54,822 --> 00:57:58,054
And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us?
You are sure of that?

634
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:58,997
Yes.

635
00:57:59,022 --> 00:58:02,711
We'll have to hope there's still
an Imperial ship left to steal.

636
00:58:02,736 --> 00:58:04,015
Here's what we're doing.

637
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,088
Hopefully, the storm keeps up
and keeps us hidden down here.

638
00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:09,213
Bodhi, you're coming with me.

639
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:10,829
We'll go up the ridge
and check it out.

640
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,329
I'm coming with you.

641
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:15,059
No, your father's message,
we can't risk it.

642
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,436
You're the messenger.

643
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:19,424
That's ridiculous. We all got the message.
Everyone here knows it.

644
00:58:19,449 --> 00:58:23,539
One blast to the reactor module
and the whole system goes down.

645
00:58:23,564 --> 00:58:26,242
That's how you said it.
The whole system goes down.

646
00:58:26,267 --> 00:58:28,454
Get to work fixing our comms!

647
00:58:29,011 --> 00:58:32,411
All I want to do right now is get a
handle on what we're up against.

648
00:58:32,436 --> 00:58:36,768
So, we're going to go very small and very carefully
up the rise and see what's what.

649
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,114
Let's get out of here.

650
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,908
Does he look like a killer?

651
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,814
No.
He has the face of a friend.

652
00:58:56,839 --> 00:58:58,836
Who are you talking about?

653
00:58:58,861 --> 00:59:00,795
Captain Andor.

654
00:59:01,143 --> 00:59:03,847
Why do you ask that? What do you mean,
does he look like a killer?

655
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:08,618
The Force moves darkly near
a creature that's about to kill.

656
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:13,202
His weapon was in the
sniper configuration.

657
00:59:18,049 --> 00:59:20,678
No, no, no...
We got to go up.

658
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,891
You can't see much from down there.

659
00:59:56,046 --> 00:59:57,462
This way.

660
00:59:57,996 --> 01:00:00,044
I'll be right behind you.

661
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,083
Come on.

662
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:20,364
Where are you going?

663
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:24,536
I'm going to follow Jyn.
Her path is clear.

664
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:27,686
Alone?
Good luck!

665
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:30,884
I don't need luck,
I have you!

666
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:41,745
What are they doing?

667
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:44,830
If Cassian comes back,
we're leaving without them.

668
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:05,191
You see Erso out there?

669
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,640
We've come too far.

670
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:18,830
Patience, my friend.

671
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:30,373
That's him.

672
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:33,329
That's him, Galen, in the dark suit.

673
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:51,733
Get back down there,
and find us a ride out of here.

674
01:01:51,852 --> 01:01:53,267
What are you doing?

675
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,466
- You heard me.
- You said we came up here just to have a look

676
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:58,246
I'm here, I'm looking.
Go.

677
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:00,449
Hurry!

678
01:02:10,904 --> 01:02:15,564
Excellent news, Galen.
The battle station is complete.

679
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:17,688
You must be very proud.

680
01:02:17,954 --> 01:02:19,997
Proud as I can be, Krennic.

681
01:02:20,022 --> 01:02:22,907
Gather your engineers,
I have an announcement.

682
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:42,158
Is that all of them?
- Yes.

683
01:02:47,018 --> 01:02:48,151
Gentlemen.

684
01:02:48,176 --> 01:02:52,214
 One of you betrayed the Empire.

685
01:02:53,395 --> 01:03:00,293
One of you has conspired with a pilot
to send messages to the Rebellion.

686
01:03:00,355 --> 01:03:04,708
And I urge that traitor step forward.

687
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:20,832
Very well, I'll consider it a group effort, then.

688
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:23,407
Ready!
- No.
- No, please.

689
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:24,966
Aim...

690
01:03:25,794 --> 01:03:26,999
- and...
- No, no.

691
01:03:27,024 --> 01:03:31,522
- fire!
- Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me.

692
01:03:31,547 --> 01:03:33,366
It was me.

693
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:46,831
They have nothing to do with it.
Spare them.

694
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:13,216
Fire!

695
01:04:24,939 --> 01:04:27,337
How do I know
the weapon is complete?

696
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:31,657
Let me share with you some details..

697
01:04:45,604 --> 01:04:46,967
Cassian.

698
01:04:46,992 --> 01:04:48,483
Cassian, can you hear me?

699
01:04:48,508 --> 01:04:49,935
I'm here.
You got it working.

700
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,122
Affirmative yes, although we have a problem!

701
01:04:52,147 --> 01:04:54,080
There's an Alliance squadron approaching.

702
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,762
- Clear the area!
- No. No, no, no!

703
01:04:55,787 --> 01:04:59,144
Tell them to hold up!
Jyn's on that platform!

704
01:05:01,642 --> 01:05:03,099
Jedha.

705
01:05:03,702 --> 01:05:06,959
Saw Gerrera.
His band of fanatics.

706
01:05:06,984 --> 01:05:12,719
Their Holy City.
The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone.

707
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:15,331
You'll never win.

708
01:05:15,575 --> 01:05:18,478
Now where have I heard that before?

709
01:05:19,651 --> 01:05:21,939
Relay from Captain Andor.

710
01:05:21,964 --> 01:05:25,279
- General.
- Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support.

711
01:05:25,303 --> 01:05:28,225
Alliance forces onsite.
Please confirm.

712
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,948
Get the squadron leader on,
Get him on now!

713
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:32,393
They're already engaged, sir.

714
01:05:55,546 --> 01:05:56,956
Dead

715
01:05:56,981 --> 01:05:58,376
No.

716
01:05:58,822 --> 01:06:01,967
Return fire!
To your stations.

717
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:04,378
Get our fighters in the air now!

718
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:12,276
Father!

719
01:06:46,557 --> 01:06:49,823
- Go, go, go, go.
- Fall back! Fall back!

720
01:06:49,848 --> 01:06:52,753
Director, we need to evacuate.

721
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:06,105
Papa.
Papa, it's me.

722
01:08:09,061 --> 01:08:10,729
It's Jyn.

723
01:08:11,163 --> 01:08:12,634
Jyn.

724
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:15,796
Stardust.

725
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,029
Papa.

726
01:08:18,788 --> 01:08:20,752
I've seen
your message.

727
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:22,950
The hologram, I've seen it.

728
01:08:23,654 --> 01:08:25,792
It must be destroyed

729
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:28,297
I know.
I know.

730
01:08:28,769 --> 01:08:30,299
We will.

731
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:32,463
Jyn.

732
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:36,877
Look at you.

733
01:08:39,538 --> 01:08:42,080
I've so much to tell you.

734
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:53,878
Papa.

735
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:56,591
No. No…

736
01:08:56,616 --> 01:09:00,492
Papa…
Papa! Come on.

737
01:09:00,618 --> 01:09:02,284
Over there, take them down.

738
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:06,032
Come on.

739
01:09:07,126 --> 01:09:10,196
- Jyn, we've got to go. Come on.
- I can't leave him,

740
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:12,785
Listen to me.
He's gone.

741
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:14,392
There's nothing you can do.
Come on.

742
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,347
- I can't leave him.
- Come on!

743
01:09:16,372 --> 01:09:18,474
- Help me.
- Move!

744
01:09:25,277 --> 01:09:26,672
Down!

745
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:33,252
Come on.
Come on.

746
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,738
Well done.
You're a Rebel now.

747
01:09:59,878 --> 01:10:02,279
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, let's move!

748
01:10:02,304 --> 01:10:04,316
Come on, let's get out of here.

749
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:05,915
Move, move, move.

750
01:10:06,575 --> 01:10:08,956
Okay, K-2, let's go.

751
01:10:09,028 --> 01:10:10,649
Copy that.

752
01:10:27,828 --> 01:10:32,087
- Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.
- Understood.

753
01:10:49,956 --> 01:10:51,875
You lied to me.

754
01:10:52,391 --> 01:10:54,016
You're in shock.

755
01:10:54,842 --> 01:10:57,263
You went up there to kill my father.

756
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:00,145
You don't know
what you're talking about.

757
01:11:00,201 --> 01:11:01,811
Deny it

758
01:11:02,337 --> 01:11:05,739
You're in shock,
and looking for someplace to put it.

759
01:11:06,025 --> 01:11:08,617
- I've seen it before.
- I bet you have.

760
01:11:08,642 --> 01:11:10,004
They know.

761
01:11:10,029 --> 01:11:13,649
You lied about why we came here and
you lied about why you went up alone.

762
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:18,725
I had every chance to pull the trigger.
But did I?

763
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,129
Did I?

764
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,868
You might as well have.

765
01:11:25,264 --> 01:11:27,998
My father was living proof and you put him at risk.

766
01:11:28,023 --> 01:11:30,595
Those were Alliance bombs
that killed him!

767
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:34,720
I had orders!
Orders that I disobeyed!

768
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:37,623
- But you wouldn't understand that.
- Orders?

769
01:11:37,648 --> 01:11:39,574
When you know they're wrong?

770
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,727
You might as well be a stormtrooper.

771
01:11:43,752 --> 01:11:45,633
What do you know?

772
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:50,057
We don't all have the luxury of deciding when
and where we want to care about something.

773
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,227
Suddenly the Rebellion is
real for you?

774
01:11:53,252 --> 01:11:55,373
Some of us live it.

775
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:59,424
I've been in this fight
since I was 6 years old.

776
01:12:01,596 --> 01:12:04,693
You're not the only one
who lost everything.

777
01:12:05,806 --> 01:12:10,258
Some of us just decided
to do something about it.

778
01:12:11,992 --> 01:12:14,492
You can't talk your way around this.

779
01:12:18,023 --> 01:12:20,044
I don't have to.

780
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,263
Yavin Four!

781
01:12:25,505 --> 01:12:28,656
Make sure they know we're
coming in with a stolen ship.

782
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:34,035
Anybody else?

783
01:13:31,108 --> 01:13:37,326
My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.

784
01:14:36,327 --> 01:14:38,878
Director Krennic.

785
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,337
Lord Vader.

786
01:14:42,197 --> 01:14:44,571
You seem unsettled.

787
01:14:44,596 --> 01:14:47,100
No.
Just pressed for time.

788
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:48,922
There're a great many things to attend
to.

789
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:51,003
My apologies.

790
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:54,688
You do have a great
many things to explain.

791
01:14:54,713 --> 01:14:57,440
I've delivered the weapon
the Emperor requested

792
01:14:57,465 --> 01:15:05,644
I deserve an audience to make certain
he understands its remarkable potential.

793
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:10,140
Its power to create problems
has certainly been confirmed.

794
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:12,111
A city destroyed.

795
01:15:12,136 --> 01:15:15,555
An Imperial facility openly attacked.

796
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:19,033
It was Governor Tarkin
that suggested the test.

797
01:15:19,672 --> 01:15:23,697
You were not summoned here to grovel,
Director Krennic.

798
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:26,663
- No, I...
- There is no Death Star.

799
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:31,541
The Senate has been informed that
Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.

800
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:32,791
Yes, my lord.

801
01:15:32,816 --> 01:15:36,562
I expect you to not rest until
you can assure the Emperor

802
01:15:36,587 --> 01:15:42,697
that Galen Erso has not compromised
this weapon in any way.

803
01:15:44,392 --> 01:15:47,305
So I'm still in command?

804
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:53,198
You'll speak to the Emperor about—

805
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:11,601
Be careful not to choke
on your aspirations, Director.

806
01:16:22,196 --> 01:16:25,246
We must scatter the fleet.

807
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:28,044
We have no recourse but to surrender.

808
01:16:28,341 --> 01:16:33,040
Are we really talking about disbanding
something that we've worked so hard to create?

809
01:16:33,065 --> 01:16:36,359
- We can't just give in.
- We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!

810
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:39,693
- We've only now managed to gather our forces.
- Gather our forces?

811
01:16:39,718 --> 01:16:42,748
General Draven's already blown up
an Imperial base!

812
01:16:42,773 --> 01:16:44,542
A decision needed to be made.

813
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:47,105
If it's war you want,
you'll fight alone!

814
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:49,570
If that's the way it's going,
why have an Alliance at all?

815
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:52,699
If she's telling the truth,
we need to act now!

816
01:16:52,724 --> 01:16:54,281
Councilors, please!

817
01:16:54,306 --> 01:16:59,412
It is simple, the Empire has the means of
mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.

818
01:16:59,437 --> 01:17:01,215
A Death Star, this is nonsense.

819
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,327
What reason would my father have to lie?
What benefit would it bring him?

820
01:17:04,352 --> 01:17:08,826
To lure our forces into a final battle.
To destroy us once and for all.

821
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:12,872
To risk everything, based on what?
The testimony of a criminal?

822
01:17:12,897 --> 01:17:15,857
The dying words of her father,
an Imperial scientist?

823
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,575
Don't forget the Imperial pilot.

824
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,865
My father gave his life so that
we may have a chance to defeat this.

825
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,129
So you've told us.

826
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:26,427
If the Empire has this kind of power,
what chance do we have?

827
01:17:26,453 --> 01:17:28,656
What chance do we have?

828
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:31,740
The question is 'What choice?'

829
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:35,629
Run? Hide? Plead for mercy?
Scatter your forces?

830
01:17:35,654 --> 01:17:38,427
You give way to an enemy
this evil with this much power

831
01:17:38,452 --> 01:17:41,489
and you condemn the galaxy
to an eternity of submission.

832
01:17:41,514 --> 01:17:43,404
- The time to fight is now!
- Yes.

833
01:17:43,429 --> 01:17:47,454
Every moment you waste is another
step closer to the ashes of Jedha.

834
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:51,060
- What is she proposing?
- Just let the girl speak!

835
01:17:51,085 --> 01:17:53,569
Send your best troops to Scarif.

836
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:58,655
Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to.

837
01:17:58,732 --> 01:18:02,969
We need to capture the Death Star plans
if there is any hope of destroying it.

838
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:12,071
You're asking us to invade an Imperial
installation based on nothing but hope?

839
01:18:13,294 --> 01:18:15,883
Rebellions are built on hope.

840
01:18:17,556 --> 01:18:19,284
There is no hope.

841
01:18:19,309 --> 01:18:21,286
I say we fight.

842
01:18:21,311 --> 01:18:24,430
I say the Rebellion is finished.

843
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,901
I'm sorry, Jyn.

844
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:34,902
Without the full support
of the council,

845
01:18:36,182 --> 01:18:38,238
the odds are too great.

846
01:18:57,669 --> 01:19:03,039
General Bendola,
please report to the briefing room.

847
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:04,526
You don't look happy.

848
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:07,289
- They prefer to surrender.
- And you?

849
01:19:07,314 --> 01:19:10,548
- She wants to fight.
- So do I. We all do.

850
01:19:10,572 --> 01:19:13,021
The Force is strong.

851
01:19:13,202 --> 01:19:15,781
I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.

852
01:19:15,806 --> 01:19:18,944
- How many do we need?
- What are you talking about?

853
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:28,635
They were never going to believe you.

854
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,906
I appreciate the support.

855
01:19:30,931 --> 01:19:32,420
But I do.

856
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,225
I believe you.

857
01:19:41,495 --> 01:19:43,437
We'd like to volunteer

858
01:19:45,508 --> 01:19:46,951
Some of us...

859
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,939
... most of us,

860
01:19:49,505 --> 01:19:52,975
we've done terrible things
on behalf of the Rebellion.

861
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:58,782
We're spies.
Saboteurs. Assassins.

862
01:19:59,943 --> 01:20:01,856
Everything I did,

863
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:04,143
I did for the Rebellion.

864
01:20:04,776 --> 01:20:08,605
And every time I walked away from
something I wanted to forget

865
01:20:09,695 --> 01:20:13,436
 I told myself it was for a cause
that I believed in.

866
01:20:14,655 --> 01:20:16,690
A cause that was worth it.

867
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:20,109
Without that, we're lost.

868
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:23,583
Everything we've done would
have been for nothing.

869
01:20:26,786 --> 01:20:29,867
I couldn't face myself
if I gave up now.

870
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,539
None of us could.

871
01:20:39,306 --> 01:20:41,348
It won't be comfortable.

872
01:20:41,373 --> 01:20:44,279
It'll be a bit cramped,
but we'll all fit.

873
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:47,885
We could go.

874
01:20:49,677 --> 01:20:51,404
Okay.
Gear up.

875
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:54,056
Grab anything that's not nailed down.

876
01:20:55,823 --> 01:20:56,871
Go, go, go!

877
01:20:56,896 --> 01:20:58,236
Jyn.

878
01:20:58,851 --> 01:21:00,861
I'll be there for you.

879
01:21:03,021 --> 01:21:05,614
Cassian said I had to.

880
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:14,325
I'm not used to people sticking around
when things go bad

881
01:21:14,775 --> 01:21:16,565
Welcome home.

882
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:22,305
Bravo team to the Intelligence office
for extraction mission report.

883
01:21:40,793 --> 01:21:42,850
May the Force be with us.

884
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,492
Cargo shuttle, read back, please.

885
01:21:50,517 --> 01:21:52,657
What's going on out there?

886
01:21:53,373 --> 01:21:57,795
That ship's off limits. No one is suppose
to be on board until farther instructions.

887
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:01,209
Yes, yes we are.
Affirmative.

888
01:22:01,234 --> 01:22:05,278
That's an impounded Imperial ship.
What's your call sign, pilot?

889
01:22:05,305 --> 01:22:07,699
- Um.
- We have to go.

890
01:22:07,724 --> 01:22:09,403
It-It's um...

891
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,600
Say something.
Come on.

892
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:15,078
Rogue...

893
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:18,373
Rogue One.

894
01:22:18,398 --> 01:22:22,003
Rogue One?
There is no Rogue One.

895
01:22:22,028 --> 01:22:23,988
Well, there is now.

896
01:22:24,445 --> 01:22:28,532
- Rogue One, pulling away.
- Pulling away.

897
01:22:42,497 --> 01:22:45,559
Despite what the others say,
war is inevitable

898
01:22:45,584 --> 01:22:47,834
Yes, I agree.
I must return to Alderaan

899
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:51,338
 to inform my people
that there will be no peace.

900
01:22:51,725 --> 01:22:54,395
We will need every advantage.

901
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:58,877
Your friend, the Jedi.

902
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:02,720
He served me well
during the Clone Wars

903
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:05,149
and has lived in hiding
since the Emperor's purge.

904
01:23:05,174 --> 01:23:06,817
Yes, I will send for him.

905
01:23:06,842 --> 01:23:09,073
You'll need someone you can trust.

906
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:13,463
I would trust her with my life.

907
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:16,857
- Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you.
- Senator.

908
01:23:26,976 --> 01:23:30,168
Okay, we're coming in.

909
01:23:30,328 --> 01:23:33,541
There's a planetwide defensive shield
with a single main entry gate.

910
01:23:33,566 --> 01:23:36,973
This shuttle should be equipped with
an access code that allows us through.

911
01:23:36,998 --> 01:23:40,474
Assuming, the Empire hasn't
logged it as overdue.

912
01:23:40,499 --> 01:23:42,301
And if they have?

913
01:23:43,516 --> 01:23:48,611
Then,they shut the gate and we're all
annihilated in the cold, dark vacuum of space.

914
01:23:49,418 --> 01:23:51,178
Not me,

915
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:54,474
I can survive in space.

916
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:08,113
Okay.
Here it goes…

917
01:24:12,178 --> 01:24:16,985
Cargo shuttle SW-0608
requesting a landing pad.

918
01:24:18,465 --> 01:24:22,943
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,
you're not listed on the arrival schedule.

919
01:24:22,968 --> 01:24:25,117
Acknowledged, Gate Control.

920
01:24:25,142 --> 01:24:28,141
We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station.

921
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:31,477
- Transmitting clearance code now.
- Transmitting.

922
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:47,249
Cargo shuttle SW-0608?

923
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,440
-You are cleared for entry.
- Yes!

924
01:24:51,414 --> 01:24:53,064
Impressive.

925
01:24:57,526 --> 01:24:59,439
I'll tell the others.

926
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:02,440
Okay.

927
01:25:19,371 --> 01:25:25,714
SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9.
Acknowledge, please.

928
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,673
SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed.

929
01:25:29,698 --> 01:25:31,940
The main building down there,
what is it?

930
01:25:31,973 --> 01:25:36,489
That's the Citadel Tower.
They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there.

931
01:25:36,514 --> 01:25:38,981
If the plans are anywhere,
they'll be there.

932
01:25:39,006 --> 01:25:42,017
The dish at the top?
What's it for?

933
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:45,204
I guess it takes a lot of signals
to send those data files out.

934
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:50,181
Landing track engaged

935
01:25:50,594 --> 01:25:52,534
Landing track locked.

936
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:05,239
We're landing.

937
01:26:07,342 --> 01:26:08,979
We're coming in!

938
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:17,542
Saw Gerrera used to say,
One fighter with a sharp stick

939
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:20,447
and nothing left to lose
can take the day.

940
01:26:23,881 --> 01:26:26,024
They have no idea we're coming.

941
01:26:26,377 --> 01:26:28,936
They have no reason to expect us.

942
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:32,718
If we can make it to the ground,
we'll take the next chance.

943
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:36,653
And the next.
On and on until we win...

944
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:41,023
 or the chances are spent.

945
01:26:43,408 --> 01:26:46,027
The Death Star plans are down there.

946
01:26:46,711 --> 01:26:50,247
Cassian, Kay-Tu, and I will find them.

947
01:26:51,763 --> 01:26:54,234
We'll find a way to find them.

948
01:26:55,607 --> 01:27:00,982
Melshi, Pao, Baze, Chirrut,
you'll take main squad,

949
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,023
move east and get wide of the ship.

950
01:27:03,048 --> 01:27:05,998
Find a position between here and the
tower.

951
01:27:06,023 --> 01:27:10,658
Once you get to the best spot,
light the place up.

952
01:27:10,683 --> 01:27:14,041
- Make ten men feel like a hundred.
- All right.

953
01:27:14,402 --> 01:27:17,040
And get those troopers away from us.

954
01:27:17,277 --> 01:27:18,732
What should I do?

955
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:23,126
Keep the engine running.
You're our only way out of here.

956
01:27:52,983 --> 01:27:59,094
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,
be prepared to receive inspection team.

957
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:00,501
Ready?

958
01:28:14,488 --> 01:28:15,276
Hello.

959
01:28:15,301 --> 01:28:18,928
Hey, you're probably looking for a manifest…

960
01:28:18,953 --> 01:28:20,945
That would be helpful.

961
01:28:21,878 --> 01:28:23,513
It's just down here.

962
01:28:31,707 --> 01:28:34,838
Director Krennic, we are entering
the Scarif shield gate.

963
01:28:34,863 --> 01:28:37,883
General Ramda has been informed
of your arrival.

964
01:29:01,841 --> 01:29:04,938
Good luck, little sister.

965
01:29:10,948 --> 01:29:13,206
Go!
Go now, you're clear!

966
01:29:13,246 --> 01:29:16,249
All right, let's go.
Come on. Move, move, move.

967
01:29:44,806 --> 01:29:46,432
I have a bad feeling about—

968
01:29:46,457 --> 01:29:47,663
- Kay!
- Quiet.

969
01:29:47,688 --> 01:29:48,978
What?

970
01:30:25,249 --> 01:30:26,560
We need a map.

971
01:30:26,585 --> 01:30:29,528
Well, I'm sure there's one
just lying about.

972
01:30:29,553 --> 01:30:32,018
You know what you have to do.

973
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:05,708
One per pad. Pick your spot.
We want to draw them out.

974
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:08,015
I'll call the timing.
Go!

975
01:31:10,546 --> 01:31:11,585
Hey, did you hear the rumors?

976
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:13,642
Yeah, the T-15s have been
marked obsolete.

977
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:16,047
Oh boy, it's about time for that.

978
01:31:16,369 --> 01:31:18,022
- Hey.
- Watch out.

979
01:31:39,743 --> 01:31:41,189
What the...?

980
01:31:45,944 --> 01:31:48,142
Director, what brings you to Scarif?

981
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:56,248
Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission
he has ever sent called up for inspection.

982
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,098
All of them?

983
01:31:58,123 --> 01:32:00,669
Yes. All of them.

984
01:32:00,694 --> 01:32:02,565
Get started.

985
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:35,497
Kay?

986
01:32:35,522 --> 01:32:40,037
Our optimal route to the data vault
places only 89 stormtroopers in our path.

987
01:32:40,062 --> 01:32:44,501
We will make it no more than 33%
of the way before we are killed.

988
01:32:49,489 --> 01:32:51,200
Melshi,
talk to me.

989
01:32:51,225 --> 01:32:54,127
Ready, ready.
Standing by.

990
01:32:58,634 --> 01:33:00,340
Light it up.

991
01:33:23,371 --> 01:33:27,942
Are we blind?
Deploy the garrison! Move!

992
01:33:46,429 --> 01:33:48,019
Troopers!

993
01:33:48,615 --> 01:33:50,513
Troopers.
Troopers on the left!

994
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:19,308
Sir? Scarif base,
they're reporting a rebel incursion.

995
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:20,983
I want to speak to Director Krennic.

996
01:34:21,008 --> 01:34:24,005
He's there, sir.
On Scarif.

997
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:26,947
The original plans for this station 
are kept there, are they not?

998
01:34:26,972 --> 01:34:28,452
They are.

999
01:34:28,765 --> 01:34:32,950
Prepare for the jump to hyperspace
and inform Lord Vader.

1000
01:34:40,185 --> 01:34:41,455
Can I help you?

1001
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,539
That won't be necessary.

1002
01:34:58,055 --> 01:34:59,874
Senator!

1003
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:02,643
Senator.

1004
01:35:02,668 --> 01:35:04,001
Stop right there, Private.

1005
01:35:04,026 --> 01:35:05,731
Let him speak.

1006
01:35:06,402 --> 01:35:10,852
Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma'am.
Rebels on Scarif.

1007
01:35:11,129 --> 01:35:12,738
I need to speak to Admiral Raddus

1008
01:35:12,763 --> 01:35:16,215
He's returned to his ship
He's gone to fight.

1009
01:35:28,039 --> 01:35:29,317
No!

1010
01:35:34,098 --> 01:35:38,905
Attention all flight personnel,
please report to your commanders immediately.

1011
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:43,359
Attention all flight personnel,
please report to your commanders immediately.

1012
01:35:43,384 --> 01:35:46,258
We have been redirected to Scarif.

1013
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:50,267
Pilots, you'll be briefed by
you squadron leaders on route.

1014
01:35:50,606 --> 01:35:53,057
May the Force be with you.

1015
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:55,838
Scarif?
They're going to Scarif?

1016
01:35:55,863 --> 01:36:00,489
- Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo…?
-  Yeah, nobody tells us anything.

1017
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:10,097
Fall back!
Fall back!

1018
01:36:10,122 --> 01:36:12,284
Keep drawing them out!

1019
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:17,138
- Go. Go.
- Move. Move.

1020
01:36:17,163 --> 01:36:18,379
Come on, move up!

1021
01:36:18,404 --> 01:36:20,858
Pad 12 report to ground.
Coming at our flank, we're outnumbered.

1022
01:36:20,883 --> 01:36:23,152
Pad 12 team, what's going on down there.
Status, please.

1023
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:25,169
All Pads report in immediately.

1024
01:36:25,194 --> 01:36:26,916
Unknown, we have rebels everywhere.

1025
01:36:26,941 --> 01:36:30,333
We're taking fire, Pad 12, Pad 14
request assistance.

1026
01:36:30,767 --> 01:36:34,497
This is Pad 2, Pad 2.
I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2.

1027
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:37,006
Get on there, tell him
pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.

1028
01:36:37,031 --> 01:36:39,997
This is Pad 5, we're being overrun.
Help us!

1029
01:36:40,022 --> 01:36:43,701
Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm.
Confirm and report.

1030
01:36:43,726 --> 01:36:46,651
Get reinforcements down to
Pad 5 immediately!

1031
01:36:49,797 --> 01:36:51,849
This is not working, Kay.

1032
01:36:52,584 --> 01:36:54,317
Right hand.

1033
01:37:14,983 --> 01:37:16,310
Baze!

1034
01:37:17,484 --> 01:37:19,002
- Baze!
- What?

1035
01:37:19,027 --> 01:37:20,454
Run!

1036
01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:31,826
Retreat.
Retreat!

1037
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:53,395
This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance.
All Squadron leaders report in.

1038
01:37:53,419 --> 01:37:56,073
Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.

1039
01:37:56,098 --> 01:37:58,649
This is Gold Leader, standing by.

1040
01:37:58,674 --> 01:38:01,333
This is Red Leader, standing by.

1041
01:38:01,358 --> 01:38:03,849
Sir, those are rebel ships.

1042
01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:06,432
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately.

1043
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:10,439
Director, the rebel fleet,
it's amassing outside the shield.

1044
01:38:12,828 --> 01:38:14,669
Lock down the base.
Lock down.

1045
01:38:14,694 --> 01:38:16,886
- And close the shield?
- Do it!

1046
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:21,069
Red and Gold squadron, attack formations.
Defend the fleet.

1047
01:38:21,094 --> 01:38:24,616
Blue squadron, get to the surface
before they closed that gate.

1048
01:38:24,641 --> 01:38:25,758
Copy, your Admiral.

1049
01:38:25,783 --> 01:38:27,241
Blue squadron, on me.

1050
01:38:27,266 --> 01:38:29,290
- Copy, Blue Leader.
- Copy, Blue Leader.

1051
01:38:29,315 --> 01:38:31,097
We won't have long.

1052
01:38:42,104 --> 01:38:45,100
Close the field.
Close it!

1053
01:38:50,054 --> 01:38:51,968
Come on, come on, come on!

1054
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:53,479
Pull up!

1055
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:07,827
- Rebel fleet has arrived.
- What?

1056
01:39:07,852 --> 01:39:09,544
There's fighting on the beach,

1057
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:11,823
they've locked down the base,

1058
01:39:11,848 --> 01:39:14,617
- they've closed the shield gate.
- What does that mean?

1059
01:39:17,234 --> 01:39:18,752
We're trapped?

1060
01:39:19,444 --> 01:39:21,825
We could transmit the plans
to the rebel fleet.

1061
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,453
We'd have to get a signal out
to tell them it's coming.

1062
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:27,781
It's the size of the data files.
That's the problem.

1063
01:39:27,806 --> 01:39:29,862
They'll never get through.

1064
01:39:30,329 --> 01:39:33,090
Someone has to take
that shield gate down.

1065
01:39:33,115 --> 01:39:35,311
Bodhi.
Bodhi, can you hear me?

1066
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:37,400
Bodhi, tell me you're out there.

1067
01:39:37,716 --> 01:39:39,193
Bodhi!

1068
01:39:39,218 --> 01:39:41,702
Hello, I'm here.
We're standing by.

1069
01:39:41,727 --> 01:39:43,194
They've started fighting,
the base is on lockdown!

1070
01:39:43,219 --> 01:39:46,476
I know, listen to me!
The rebel fleet is up there.

1071
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:48,374
You've got to tell them to
blow a hole in the shield gate

1072
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,776
 so we can transmit the plans

1073
01:39:50,801 --> 01:39:55,455
Wait, I can't. I'm not hooked into
the comm tower. We're not tied in.

1074
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,486
It's the only way
we're getting them out of here.

1075
01:39:57,514 --> 01:40:00,811
Find a way!
Cover our backs.

1076
01:40:02,899 --> 01:40:04,568
You'll need this.

1077
01:40:06,013 --> 01:40:07,836
You wanted one, right?

1078
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:15,049
Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected.

1079
01:40:15,074 --> 01:40:17,458
Jyn.
Come on.

1080
01:40:37,904 --> 01:40:39,742
Fire on my command.

1081
01:40:55,451 --> 01:40:56,827
Look!

1082
01:41:07,203 --> 01:41:09,291
Get ready.
We're going to have to go out there.

1083
01:41:11,803 --> 01:41:13,454
What're you doing?

1084
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:16,158
They closed the shield gate,
we're stuck here.

1085
01:41:16,183 --> 01:41:18,748
But, the rebel fleet is pulling in.

1086
01:41:18,773 --> 01:41:20,633
We just have to get a signal
strong enough to get through to them

1087
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:23,054
and let them know
we're trapped down here.

1088
01:41:23,079 --> 01:41:24,933
For that, we have to connect to
the communications tower.

1089
01:41:24,958 --> 01:41:27,269
Now, I can patch us in over here,
the landing pad

1090
01:41:27,294 --> 01:41:30,174
but you have to get on the radio,
get one of the guys out there to find

1091
01:41:30,199 --> 01:41:31,929
a master switch.

1092
01:41:31,954 --> 01:41:35,882
Get them to activate the connection between
us and that comm tower. Okay.

1093
01:41:35,907 --> 01:41:37,328
Then go!

1094
01:41:40,381 --> 01:41:42,471
What's going on down there, Lieutenant?

1095
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:44,583
Unknown, sir.
We can't raise them.

1096
01:41:44,608 --> 01:41:46,917
All rebel frequencies are blocked.

1097
01:41:46,942 --> 01:41:51,480
Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers
and let's start probing that shield.

1098
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:52,998
Yes, sir.

1099
01:41:54,383 --> 01:41:56,056
We're going in.

1100
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,781
Stay with me.

1101
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:41,939
Schematics bank, Data tower two.

1102
01:42:41,964 --> 01:42:44,699
- How do I find that?
- Searching.

1103
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:49,380
I can locate the tape, but you'll need
the handles for extraction.

1104
01:42:52,817 --> 01:42:55,230
What are we supposed to do with these?

1105
01:42:56,764 --> 01:42:58,302
Whoa.

1106
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:15,971
- Well, finally.
- Wait, stop.

1107
01:43:15,996 --> 01:43:19,275
The rebels!
They went…over there.

1108
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,797
Kay.
What's going on out there?

1109
01:43:21,822 --> 01:43:23,339
There's one.

1110
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:24,808
Oh well.

1111
01:43:35,883 --> 01:43:37,245
Come on!

1112
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:46,013
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader,

1113
01:43:46,038 --> 01:43:48,406
we're starting our attack run
on the shield gate.

1114
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:51,340
Keep it tight and watch out
for those towers.

1115
01:44:04,743 --> 01:44:07,589
More fighters.
Form up, at 65.

1116
01:44:08,029 --> 01:44:10,948
Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

1117
01:44:17,637 --> 01:44:20,276
Melshi.
Melshi, come in, are you there?

1118
01:44:20,705 --> 01:44:22,960
Bodhi will send a signal from here.
He's patching us in.

1119
01:44:22,985 --> 01:44:25,193
But you guys have to
open up a line for the tower.

1120
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:26,926
How?
Please advise.

1121
01:44:26,951 --> 01:44:29,444
There's a master switch to the base
of the Comm tower.

1122
01:44:29,469 --> 01:44:32,282
Master switch, describe,
what are we looking for?

1123
01:44:32,307 --> 01:44:35,630
What does it look like, the master switch?
Where is it?

1124
01:44:35,655 --> 01:44:38,120
Two wings, reinforce those troops
on the beach.

1125
01:44:38,145 --> 01:44:41,798
All fighters, on me.
We have to shield them from air attack.

1126
01:44:43,037 --> 01:44:46,167
Troop reinforcements.
Here we go.

1127
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:51,227
- For Jedha!
- Jedha!

1128
01:44:56,755 --> 01:44:59,161
We have no effect on that shield.

1129
01:44:59,186 --> 01:45:01,537
How much more can that thing take?

1130
01:45:03,167 --> 01:45:06,177
Stick close, Red 5,
where are you going?

1131
01:45:07,237 --> 01:45:09,104
I'm trying to lose them.

1132
01:45:10,073 --> 01:45:12,859
This is Red 5, I need help!

1133
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,273
Hyperspace Tracking,

1134
01:45:20,298 --> 01:45:22,251
Navigational Systems.

1135
01:45:22,276 --> 01:45:26,481
Two screens down.
Structural Engineering, open that one!

1136
01:45:28,099 --> 01:45:30,077
I got one on my tail.

1137
01:45:30,259 --> 01:45:31,765
I'm on it.

1138
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:50,293
“Project code names:
Stellarsphere. Mark Omega. Pax Aurora…

1139
01:46:01,447 --> 01:46:06,215
War-Mantle. Cluster-Prism.
Black-Saber.

1140
01:46:06,978 --> 01:46:08,006
What?

1141
01:46:08,031 --> 01:46:09,543
Stardust.

1142
01:46:11,645 --> 01:46:12,803
That's it.

1143
01:46:12,828 --> 01:46:14,483
How do you know that?

1144
01:46:15,161 --> 01:46:17,240
I know because it's me.

1145
01:46:19,394 --> 01:46:22,286
Hey, you.
Identify yourself.

1146
01:46:26,062 --> 01:46:27,472
I can explain.

1147
01:46:27,995 --> 01:46:30,118
Incoming fire, take cover!

1148
01:46:37,548 --> 01:46:40,057
Kay, we need the file for Stardust!

1149
01:46:43,338 --> 01:46:44,871
Stardust.

1150
01:46:48,555 --> 01:46:49,950
That's it.

1151
01:47:11,176 --> 01:47:12,335
Kay.

1152
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,638
Climb.

1153
01:47:13,663 --> 01:47:15,242
Climb.

1154
01:47:15,267 --> 01:47:18,700
You can still send the plans to the fleet.

1155
01:47:18,725 --> 01:47:23,666
If they open the shield gate,
you can broadcast from the tower!

1156
01:47:23,738 --> 01:47:26,446
- Locking the bolt door now.
- Kay.

1157
01:47:27,019 --> 01:47:27,867
Kay!

1158
01:47:27,892 --> 01:47:29,847
- Good bye.
- Kay!

1159
01:47:46,451 --> 01:47:49,924
Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault.

1160
01:47:50,726 --> 01:47:53,129
- What.
- It's just come in, sir.

1161
01:47:56,900 --> 01:48:00,956
Send my guard squadron into battle!
Two men with me now!

1162
01:48:01,178 --> 01:48:03,969
Get that beach under control!

1163
01:48:05,071 --> 01:48:06,267
Bodhi?
Are you there?

1164
01:48:06,292 --> 01:48:08,110
Have you got the switch?

1165
01:48:08,199 --> 01:48:12,425
I can't get to the shuttle,
I can't plug in!

1166
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:14,549
You have to!
They have to hit that gate.

1167
01:48:14,574 --> 01:48:17,601
If the shield's open,
we can send the plans!

1168
01:48:47,433 --> 01:48:49,428
General, behind you!

1169
01:48:59,753 --> 01:49:01,230
Take them out.

1170
01:49:02,927 --> 01:49:04,447
Step back.

1171
01:49:12,842 --> 01:49:14,872
We're going down!

1172
01:49:19,959 --> 01:49:21,501
Come on!

1173
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:23,514
Look out.

1174
01:50:23,008 --> 01:50:25,742
Melshi.
Melshi, come in please.

1175
01:50:25,767 --> 01:50:28,883
I'm tied in at my end,
I just need an open line.

1176
01:50:28,908 --> 01:50:30,316
Hang on.

1177
01:50:31,184 --> 01:50:35,614
The master switch,
it's over at that console.

1178
01:50:38,785 --> 01:50:40,299
I'm going!

1179
01:50:49,825 --> 01:50:51,412
I've got it.

1180
01:50:52,924 --> 01:50:54,299
Careful!

1181
01:50:55,309 --> 01:50:56,699
You okay?

1182
01:51:05,288 --> 01:51:06,617
Jyn!

1183
01:51:23,971 --> 01:51:26,415
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1184
01:51:27,609 --> 01:51:28,933
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1185
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:30,384
Chirrut!

1186
01:51:39,868 --> 01:51:42,337
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1187
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:44,716
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1188
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:46,928
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1189
01:51:46,953 --> 01:51:49,041
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1190
01:51:49,066 --> 01:51:51,413
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1191
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:53,899
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1192
01:51:54,203 --> 01:51:56,819
Chirrut, come back!

1193
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:07,411
Yes!

1194
01:52:11,244 --> 01:52:13,490
Keep going.
Keep going!

1195
01:52:17,259 --> 01:52:18,816
Cassian.

1196
01:52:28,225 --> 01:52:31,883
Chirrut, come!
Come with me!

1197
01:52:35,562 --> 01:52:37,138
Chirrut!

1198
01:52:42,524 --> 01:52:46,106
Chirrut, don't go.
Don't go.

1199
01:52:46,131 --> 01:52:48,496
I'm here.
I'm here.

1200
01:52:48,521 --> 01:52:52,167
It's okay.
It's okay.

1201
01:52:52,959 --> 01:52:55,565
- Look for the Force,
- Chirrut.

1202
01:52:55,736 --> 01:52:59,116
and you will always find me.

1203
01:52:59,636 --> 01:53:01,902
The Force is with me.

1204
01:53:02,179 --> 01:53:04,441
I'm one with the Force.

1205
01:53:04,466 --> 01:53:06,670
The Force is with me.

1206
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:09,092
I'm one with the Force.

1207
01:53:09,117 --> 01:53:11,341
The Force is with me.

1208
01:53:11,476 --> 01:53:14,070
and I'm one with the Force.

1209
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:30,975
Deflector shield's down to 50%,
we're sustaining heavy damage.

1210
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,846
There's no turning back now,
we have to press the attack.

1211
01:53:40,182 --> 01:53:41,532
Hit that opening.

1212
01:53:41,557 --> 01:53:42,965
We see it, Gold Leader.

1213
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:44,966
Ion torpedoes away.

1214
01:53:54,664 --> 01:53:57,749
- What's happening?
- We've lost engine power, sir.

1215
01:54:00,188 --> 01:54:02,602
That Star Destroyer is disabled.

1216
01:54:03,976 --> 01:54:06,859
This is Rogue One, calling any
Alliance ships that can hear me!

1217
01:54:09,019 --> 01:54:11,518
Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One!
Come in, over.

1218
01:54:11,543 --> 01:54:14,750
This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One,
we hear you!

1219
01:54:16,465 --> 01:54:18,178
We have the plans!

1220
01:54:18,709 --> 01:54:21,950
They found the Death Star plans. They have
to transmit them from the communications tower!

1221
01:54:21,975 --> 01:54:25,559
You have to take down the shield gate.
It's the only way to going to get them through!

1222
01:54:26,545 --> 01:54:29,693
Call up a Hammerhead corvette.
I have an idea.

1223
01:54:29,718 --> 01:54:33,175
- Standby, Rogue One, we're on it.
- This is for you, Galen,

1224
01:55:01,492 --> 01:55:05,799
The Force is with me.
I'm one with the Force.

1225
01:55:56,441 --> 01:55:58,946
Corvette 5, locked on target.

1226
01:55:59,539 --> 01:56:01,370
Prepare for impact.

1227
01:56:12,941 --> 01:56:15,449
Sublight thrusters, full power!

1228
01:56:51,195 --> 01:56:53,877
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1229
01:56:54,707 --> 01:56:57,381
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1230
01:56:58,165 --> 01:57:00,777
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1231
01:57:01,418 --> 01:57:04,027
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1232
01:57:26,949 --> 01:57:29,516
Reverse engines, full power!

1233
01:57:50,241 --> 01:57:53,554
<font color="#ff80c0">Antenna alignment.
Ready to transmit.</font>

1234
01:58:27,697 --> 01:58:29,640
Who are you?

1235
01:58:31,091 --> 01:58:33,094
You know who I am.

1236
01:58:35,357 --> 01:58:37,300
I'm Jyn Erso.

1237
01:58:37,325 --> 01:58:39,722
Daughter of Galen and Lyra.

1238
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:41,350
You've lost.

1239
01:58:41,375 --> 01:58:43,357
Oh, I have, have I?

1240
01:58:43,382 --> 01:58:46,572
My father's revenge.
He built a flaw in the Death Star.

1241
01:58:46,597 --> 01:58:48,524
He put a fuse in the
middle of your machine

1242
01:58:48,549 --> 01:58:51,616
and I've just told the
entire galaxy how to light it.

1243
01:58:51,641 --> 01:58:56,515
The shield is up, your signal
will never reach the rebel base.

1244
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:58,875
All you ships in here
will be destroyed.

1245
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:01,243
I lose nothing but time.

1246
01:59:01,268 --> 01:59:06,594
YOU on the other hand
die with the Rebellion.

1247
01:59:36,609 --> 01:59:38,226
<font color="#ff80c0">Transmitting.</font>

1248
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:42,331
<font color="#ff80c0">Transmitting.</font>

1249
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:47,022
Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif.

1250
01:59:55,317 --> 01:59:57,994
Hey, leave it.
Leave it.

1251
01:59:58,019 --> 01:59:59,202
That's it.

1252
02:00:00,535 --> 02:00:01,932
That's it.

1253
02:00:03,477 --> 02:00:04,639
Let's go.

1254
02:00:04,664 --> 02:00:06,248
Transmission received.

1255
02:00:06,273 --> 02:00:09,115
Admiral, we have the plans!

1256
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:10,690
She did it.

1257
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:15,060
Do you think,
anybody is listening?

1258
02:00:15,856 --> 02:00:17,215
I do.

1259
02:00:18,695 --> 02:00:20,612
Someone's out there.

1260
02:00:22,665 --> 02:00:27,211
Sir, we're detecting a massive object
emerging from hyperspace.

1261
02:00:32,872 --> 02:00:34,860
Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?

1262
02:00:34,885 --> 02:00:36,832
Lord Vader will handle the fleet.

1263
02:00:36,857 --> 02:00:40,628
Target the base at Scarif.
Single reactor ignition

1264
02:00:40,653 --> 02:00:41,969
Yes, sir.

1265
02:01:11,882 --> 02:01:14,212
You may fire when ready.

1266
02:01:19,012 --> 02:01:21,431
Commence primary ignition.

1267
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:46,440
Rogue One, may the Force be with you.

1268
02:01:49,823 --> 02:01:53,626
All ships, prepare for jump to hyperspace!

1269
02:02:25,579 --> 02:02:28,604
You father would have been
proud of you, Jyn.

1270
02:02:42,046 --> 02:02:44,414
The rebel flag ship is disabled, my lord,

1271
02:02:44,439 --> 02:02:47,098
but has received transmission
from the surface.

1272
02:02:47,123 --> 02:02:49,486
Prepare a boarding party.

1273
02:02:49,511 --> 02:02:50,998
Yes, my lord.

1274
02:03:27,112 --> 02:03:28,551
Hurry!

1275
02:03:31,852 --> 02:03:34,794
 Let go!
 We got to go now.

1276
02:03:37,958 --> 02:03:39,809
Hurry, let's go.

1277
02:03:40,548 --> 02:03:42,008
It's stuck.

1278
02:03:43,955 --> 02:03:45,492
Hey, help!

1279
02:04:02,532 --> 02:04:04,564
Open fire!

1280
02:04:09,713 --> 02:04:11,568
Help us!

1281
02:04:14,601 --> 02:04:16,212
It's jammed.

1282
02:04:23,285 --> 02:04:24,706
Push!

1283
02:04:28,132 --> 02:04:31,691
Here. Here.
Take it! Take it.

1284
02:04:39,031 --> 02:04:41,323
LAUNCH!

1285
02:05:07,499 --> 02:05:11,772
Make sure you secure the airlock.
And prepare the escape pods.

1286
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:19,131
Your Highness.
The transmission we received.

1287
02:05:20,116 --> 02:05:22,239
What is it they've sent us?

1288
02:05:23,493 --> 02:05:25,063
Hope.

1289
